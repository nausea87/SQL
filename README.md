## Background

There once was a woman named Sandra Danielsson. Loved and cherished
by everyone. But one night, on exacly _8/04/2020_, she was brutally murdered at a
_restaurant_ in _Gothenburg_.

Since the police are busy with helping with the vote counting
in the US and A, they're begging YOU to help them solve this murder.

Best of luck!
