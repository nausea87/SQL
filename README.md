# **The horrific murder of Sandra**

## Background

There once was a woman named Sandra Danielsson. Loved and cherished
by everyone. But one night, on exacly 8/04/2020, she was brutally murdered at a
restaurant in Gothenburg.

Since the police are busy with helping with the vote counting
in the US and A, they're begging YOU to help them solve this murder.

INSERT INTO solution (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('firstname', 'lastname');

Then type:

SELECT \* FROM solution;

Best of luck!
